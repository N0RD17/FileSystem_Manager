# FileSystem_Manager
FileSystem Manager made in C++! It creates file, deletes them, and also tells you files that exists in a directory. It also reads ~/ input as home/user so you can just do ~/Desktop/ and it'll read your home user desktop environment!

# PREQUISITE
This uses the POSIX-API (unistd.h) which means if your system does not have the POSIX-API header then it'll most-likely not compile.
